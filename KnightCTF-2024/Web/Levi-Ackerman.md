Yea, as you can see in the task description, we should go to `http://66.228.53.87:5000/robots.txt` to check if Levi is a robot =))

When you access the **/robots.txt**, you will see this line:

```txt
Disallow : /l3v1_4ck3rm4n.html
```

Now, you just need to visit `http://66.228.53.87:5000/l3v1_4ck3rm4n.html` to get the flag

`Flag: KCTF{1m_d01n6_17_b3c4u53_1_h4v3_70}`
